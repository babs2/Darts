Darts game

This allows a 501 game to be played by 1 player.  2 Player coming in the future.  This project was orig from Jimmy something or other.
I've attempted to create a pull request to his branch on GH, but he isn't active and I don't have permission to commit to his remote.


the adds that are deemed "unsafe" are to change the font size in the console window
If you do not want the "unsafe" 
	comment out from internal unsafe struct CONSOLE_FONT_INFO_EX down and in main comment out line with SetConsoleFont(


You will need to allow the configuration manager to update the app.config file.
	this is where I am storing the players average, and games played.
	


-- plans to create a quiz game for the outs. 
	1) Randomly select an out from the chart
	2) prompt user for the out.
	3) confirm the math works out. - provide confirmation its the "best out"
	
-- plans to add functionality to the outs section to enhance darts before there is an actual out shot.
	i.e. if you are on 189 and aim for 20's a 169 is not an out.  better to aim for 19's. as 170 is an out.
